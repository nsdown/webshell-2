# webshell

This is a little toy project, which uses
[websocketd](https://github.com/joewalnes/websocketd) to build an easy shell
in the browser. It allows you to run predefined commands and sends the output
back to the browser using websockets.

## Running `webshell`

From inside the project directory, having `websocketd` installed, you can run
it with:

```bash
$ websocketd --port=8888 --passenv=USER,HOME,PATH --staticdir=html/ ./webshell.py
```

## Security concerns

**You shouldn't make this publicly accessible!!!**

Use a normal webserver (nginx, apache ...) as a reverse proxy with a suitable
authentication method configured. [Follow these instructions for a cookie-based authentication using Nginx.](http://blog.pboehm.org/blog/2014/07/19/authentication-for-websockets/)
