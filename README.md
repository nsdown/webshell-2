# webshell

This is a little toy project, which uses
[websocketd](https://github.com/joewalnes/websocketd) to build an easy shell
in the browser. It allows you to run predefined commands and sends the output
back to the browser using websockets.

## Running `webshell`

From inside the project directory, having `websocketd` installed, you can run
it with:

```bash
$ websocketd --port=8888 --passenv=USER,HOME --staticdir=html/ ./webshell.py
```
